Regression - lets see if we can fit some line or curve to a set of points. 

Linear Regression use - 
* Prediction, forecasting, or error reduction.
* Explain variation in the response variable as due to variation in the explanatory variable. 

Linear Regression Assumptions:
* Data must be linear with respect to the output or independent variable.
* Features/Variables can't be linear with respect to each other. ie. One feature predicts the other. (aka. multicollinearity or collinearity). This doesn't make the model worse per-say, however it does prevent remove the interpretability of the features.
* 


OLS - Ordinary Least Squares = The function is optimized by minimizing the least squares error.
